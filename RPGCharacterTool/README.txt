How to use the RPG Character Creation tool:

1. Create a new Canvas item, or use one you have already created.
2. Drag and drop the rpgtool_CHARACTER prefab on the canvas
3. Click on the rpgtool_CHARACTER prefab. The tool will appear in the inspector.

4. Choose a hair style and color.
5. Choose a clothing style.
6. Don't forget to save all changes!
7. If the changes don't appear immedeately, try clicking on a different object in the hierarchy.
8. If the tool is acting strange or the hair or clothing keeps getting stuck on the same type or color,
    try resetting the character.

If you save any changes, the location of the save file will be displayed in the console. You can copy the .RPGTool 
file if you made a character you particularly like and would like to use more often. In a project that is also using
the RPG Character Creation tool, you can paste the file in the same location you copied it from, but in that 
specific project's folder.

The file location should look something like this:
C:/Users/[username]/AppData/LocalLow/[company name]/[project name]/rpgcharacter.RPGTool
